Thank you for your offer to help.  It seems to work well when I leave PWM at 5V and toggle 12V supply line.

Dear Justin
 
Hello,
 
Could you tell the status after trying to do what I said?
 
If it does not work as well, please let me  find another cause.
 
Best  regards,

Tomoaki,
 
Thank you for your rapid response. 
 
I do not recall seeing a frequency requirement on this pump.  Can you please forward me the complete spec sheet?
 
I will check the PWM frequency, but I am not having any problem controlling the rate.  Just turning the pump back on.
 
Can leave PWM pin on and just use the 12V line to turn the pump on and off, or do I have to do both?
 
We really would like to use the pump in our project, we'd like to know the full feature set and requirements please.
 
Justin

Dear Justin
 
Thank you fro your email.
 
I would like you to check two points.
 
1 Frequency. PLease check whether PWM Pulse at frequency is 15～25kHz or not.
2 I guess you turn the pump off by cutting off PWM pulse.
  If so, it makes the motor stopped in some situation.
  I would like you to turn the pump off by cutting off PWM pulse and power supply.
 
If you have any questions, let me know.

Tomoaki,
 
I have finally gotten a cable for the pump and have tested two units.  Here is what I have discovered.  I can use PWM to control the rate of the pump, but if I turn the pump off for longer than about .5 seconds, it does not come back on.  Both pumps behave in this manor.
 
Please advise.
 
Normal operation includes being on for a short interval, then being off for a long period of time and then turning back on again,
 
Thank you.
Justin

Dear Jusitn
 
 
Thank you for your reply.
 
Please let me answer your question.
FG means ‘Function Generator’.
FG is a pin that outputs pulses based on number of rotations of a motor.
 
I am sorry I can not provide  a reference circuit for this pin.
 
Thank you for your understanding.
 
Best regards.

Mr. Tomoaki,
 
Thank you for sending the documents.  I've found the pinouts and the reference circuit (see below). Can you please describe what the purpose of FG is?  Can you provide a reference circuit for this pin?

PIN
1　GND
2　Vm　[10.8～13.2V]
3　FG　[0-5.5V　pull-up　MAX5.5V,FG-LOW 0.6V less]
4　PWM　[MAX 5.0V]
5　NC

Dear Justin Shaw
 
Hi, Thank you for your email.
 
I will attach all documents I have related to P54E01R.(I guess you have already recived all from Michael Whitt)
Also, Pin out is as below.
 
PIN
1　GND
2　Vm　[10.8～13.2V]
3　FG　[0-5.5V　pull-up　MAX5.5V,FG-LOW 0.6V less]
4　PWM　[MAX 5.0V]
5　NC
 
Concerning sample cables and sample driving circuit,I am so sorry to say that we can not provide you .
We ask to customer to procure that by themselves.
 
If it did not answer all of your questions,let me know.
I will check and answer as soon as possible.

Mr. Tomoaki,
 
I am Justin Shaw with Cordex.  Michael Whitt forwarded me the documents you sent to him regarding some aspects of your P54E01R 12V rolling pump.
 
We were surprised to find a 5-pin connector when we received the 3 P54E01R pumps that Michael ordered.  We were unable to locate any documentation on the purpose of the extra pins.
 
Can you please forward the complete data sheet on this pump including:
 
1. pinout diagram
2. sample driving circuit
3. absolute voltage limits on each pin.
 
Also, do you have any cables that we can use to test the pumps?  If so, please forward them to

Thank you very much.
