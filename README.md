# uCm
uCmini is a laboratory, Open Hardware, blood pressure measurement device (not FDA approved).
Along with the hardware, we will develop an Android app to do the compute BP from the streaming raw data from uCm.  The app will store your BP history, and plot the history. The desire is to get the Open communities involved in the the algorithm development. If we use the Bluefruit Ez-link, the same hardware will work with an FTDI cable.
